Three Observable trends:

1.	While females spend more on average, males account for the majority of purchases (84%, $1,967 of $2,379.77)

2.	While not averaging the most spent per a person, age group 20-24 accounted $1,114.06 due to their 365 purchases (44.79%) 

3.	Item ID 178 (Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm) held the highest Purchase count and Total Value.  While Item 108 was tied for second with both Item 82 and 145 on Purchase Count, it failed to place in the Top 5 for Total Value due to its low Item Price.
